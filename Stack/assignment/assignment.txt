The system will generate a number set and A will get the number blocks in the same order while B gets it in the reverse order

According to the values of the blocks taken out by A and B, the system needs to generate the output as a series of 0,1 and 2 and finally display the winner.

a. If the number taken out by A is bigger than B’s, A put away the number taken out. B must put back the number block into the box. System prints 2 on the screen.
b. If the number picked by A is smaller than B’s, B put away the number taken out. A must put back the number block into the box. System prints 1 on the screen.
c. If both blocks have the same value, then both A and B put away the number blocks taken out. System prints 0 on the screen.

The winner is the one who took all the number blocks out of the box.

Example:    Input: 5 
	System generated number set: 27 23 61 44 45 (when x = 3)
	A’s number set is 27 23 61 44 45 (45 is at the top of the box)
	B’s number set is 45 44 61 23 27 (27 is at the top of the box)
	Output: 2 2 2 1 0 1 1 1
	B is the Winner
